While loop functions as expected after a few alterations to the program. 

Case 1 - When you guess the word correctly before all your lives used. 
It works as expected, once you guess all the letters such that no blanks are left, 
and you have more than or equal to one (last) life left, the user wins. 
Th e while loop breaks.

Case 2 - When no more lives are left and you have not managed to guess the word. 
The program works as expected. The while loop continues till the user has 
zero lives and hasn't guess word yet, then the program declares that the user 
has lost.
